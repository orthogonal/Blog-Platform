This is the readme for my blog page.
I wrote it in Vim just because I can.
I wanted to make a blog for some reason, I'll figure out what to put on it later but I wanted to make one.  The idea of using a platform like Wordpress or Blogger that someone else made didn't appeal to me as much as the idea of just writing the entire thing from scratch... so here I am.
